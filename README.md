# Implementation of Speech Recognition System for Security Purposes
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
## Project Overview
* Implemented Speaker Dependent Isolated Word Speech Recognition based Securtiy System using MATLAB and Arduino UNO
* Recorded  6 words  with different syllables  
* Preprocessed these words using combination of zero-crossing rate (ZCR) and Energy Calculation
* Extracted features using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
* Performed recognition using Vector Quantization (VQ) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
* Built a prototype of house and  attached the door, which is automated by using ARDUINO controlling servo motor
* Sent the recognized output from MATLAB to ARDUINO  and  ARDUINO performed open and close of the door based on the recognition ouput
* Obtained 90% of recognition accuracy for the user
